# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Project_

The project entailed creating component .jsx files in addition to App.jsx in order to create a means to map over the gallery array and retrieve the picture data. GET and PUT routes were written to properly route the information and include additional functionality like an incrementing like button and conditional rendering to flip the image and display description text. 

The stretch goals included additional functionality, such as storing and retrieving the images from a database, making it a fullstack application.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Express
- Axios
- Postgres/ Postico


## Installation


1. Create a database named `react_gallery`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
